In Greek mythology, Hyperion (/ha…™Ààp…™…ôri…ôn/; Greek: ·ΩôœÄŒµœÅŒØœâŒΩ, 'he who goes before')[1] was one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia (the Earth) and Uranus (the Sky).[2] With his sister, the Titaness Theia, Hyperion fathered Helios (the Sun), Selene (the Moon) and Eos (the Dawn).[3]

Hyperion was, along with his son Helios, a personification of the sun, with the two sometimes identified.[4] John Keats's abandoned epic poem Hyperion is among the literary works that feature the figure.


Etymology
"Hyperion" means "he that walks on high" or simply "the god above", often joined with "Helios".[5] There is a possible attestation of his name in Linear B (Mycenaean Greek) in the lacunose form ]pe-rjo-[ (Linear B: ]êÄüêÅä-[), found on the KN E 842 tablet (reconstructed [u]-pe-rjo-[ne])[6][7] though it has been suggested that the name actually reads "Apollo" ([a]-pe-rjo-[ne]).[8][9]

Mythology
Hyperion is one of the twelve or thirteen Titans, the children of Gaia and Uranus. In the Theogony, Uranus imprisoned all the children that Gaia bore him, before he was overthrown.[10] According to pseudo-Apollodorus, Uranus only imprisoned the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes but not the Titans, until Gaia persuaded her six Titan sons to overthrow their father Uranus and "they, all but Ocean, attacked him" as Cronus castrated him.[11] Afterwards, in the words of Hesiod, Hyperion subjected his sister Theia to his love, and fathered on her three children, the lights of heaven; Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn). As is the case for most of the Titans, there are no myths or functions for Hyperion.[12] He seems to exist only to provide a father for the three celestial deities.[13] As a Titan, one of the oldest generation of gods, Hyperion was a fitting father for these three sky-gods who, as elements of the natural world, must have been conceived of as having come into being near the beginning of the cosmos.[14]

Helios
Hyperion and Helios were both sun-gods. In early sources sometimes the two were considered to be distinct, with Hyperion being the father of Helios, but sometimes they were apparently identified, with Hyperion being simply a title of, or another name for, Helios himself.[15] Hyperion is Helios' father in Homer's Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony, and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter.[16] But in the Iliad and elsewhere in the Odyssey, Helios is also called "Helios Hyperion" with Hyperion here either being used as a patronymic or other epithet, while also in the Homeric epics, and in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, besides being called Helios, he is sometimes also called simply Hyperion.[17] In later sources the two sun-gods are distinctly father and son.[18] In literature, the Sun is often referred to as "Hyperion's bright son."[19]

Diodorus Siculus
According to the rationalizing historian Diodorus Siculus, Hyperion was the name of the first person to understand the movement of the sun and moon, and their effect on the seasons, and explains that, because of this, he was said to be their "father":

Of Hyperion we are told that he was the first to understand, by diligent attention and observation, the movement of both the sun and the moon and the other stars, and the seasons as well, in that they are caused by these bodies, and to make these facts known to others; and that for this reason he was called the father of these bodies, since he had begotten, so to speak, the speculation about them and their nature.[20]

Diodorus also recorded an unorthodox version of the myth, in which Hyperion married his sister Basileia and had two children by her, Helios and Selene; their brothers, envious of their happy issue and fearful that Hyperion would divert the royal power to himself, conspired and killed Hyperion along with his two children (which then went on to transform into the Sun and the Moon), leaving Basileia in great distress.[21]

Legacy
Hyperion, one of the moons of Saturn, is named after this god. Saturn itself is named after Hyperion's brother, Cronus. Roman equivalent, Saturnus.
